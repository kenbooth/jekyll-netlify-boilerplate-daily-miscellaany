If you find yourself driving across Kansas you might ask yourself, as I did, "how do I get out of here?" 

There is apparently some competition between the twine ball in Cawker City and one in xxxxx.

Nearby is the Geographic Center of the United States.

Is is combustible? I'm asking for a friend and don't intend to find out.
