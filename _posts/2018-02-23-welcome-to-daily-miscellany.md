Before we get started, I'd like to set expectations appropriately low. That is to say, if you don't expect much from this site you won't be disappointed. What you can expect to find here is a collection of writings and links on various subjects along with random bits of ephemera.

Despite the promise of the site's title I begin this project anticipating I won't make daily updates.
