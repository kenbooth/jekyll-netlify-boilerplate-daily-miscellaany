Before we get started, I'd like to set expectations appropriately low. That is to say, if you don't expect much from this site you might be wonderfully delighted.

Despite the promise of the site's title I start this project anticipating I won't make daily updates. But I can almost certainly guarantee that what is published  will be a collection of writings on various subjects along with random bits of ephemera.
