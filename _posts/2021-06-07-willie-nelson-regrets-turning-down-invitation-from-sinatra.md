> "I’ve always loved Frank Sinatra. He was my favorite singer—I always enjoyed his style, his phrasing—and, lo and behold, I read somewhere that he said I was his favorite singer. It doesn’t get any better than that. ... We would meet between shows and say hello and goodbye and "I’ll see you tomorrow" or whatever. One night—I think it was Palm Desert, he had a place there—we played a show and he asked me to come by and hang out that night and party and have some fun. But for some reason I had to get on the damn bus and go to L.A., so that didn’t happen. That’s one of my major regrets."
