Written jointly by Retired 4-Star Admiral Jim Stavridis and veteran Elliot Ackerman, *[2034: A Novel of the Next World War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54211065-2034)* is the story of a rapid escalation of events following what turned out to be anything but a routine freedom of navigation patrol in the South China Sea by U.S. Naval ships. The novel is set so closely in the future it feels as if these events could happen next week, and is a reminder of how quickly international events can escalate.

Stavridis says in the audiobook afterward that the book is meant to serve as a cautionary tale of "how devastating the outcome of a war with China might be." He wants to overcome the failure of imagination that often leads to conflicts.

The novel is a pretty high level look at events and doesn't get into the details of battles or how civilians react to the unfolding war. It might disappoint someone looking for Tom Clancy plot twists or intrigue, but it's a well written and easy to read novel that will broaden your view of world politics.
